    Copyright is dead.  Copyright remains dead, and we have killed it.  How
    shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?  What was
    holiest and mightiest of all that the world of censorship has yet owned has
    bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us?  What
    water is there for us to clean ourselves?  What festivals of atonement,
    what sacred games shall we have to invent?  Is not the greatness of this
    deed too great for us?  Must we ourselves not become authors simply to
    appear worthy of it?
                                    - apologies to Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche
